*Note that this system does not contain content from the DCC rulebook, only rollable character sheets.  Once Foundry supports discrete copyright-protectable compendia, we will work with Goodman Games to get that content ready for out-of-the-box use.  In the mean time, please see the user guide for how to import content from the PDF rulebook for your personal use.*
